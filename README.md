# Project Details
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is called news_csv. It contains news articles labeled as either real or fake. The data was collected from various sources and has been pre-processed for use in this project.

# Techniques
The Tfidf Vectorizer and Passive Aggressive Classifier libraries are used in this project to detect fake news. The Tfidf Vectorizer is used to convert the text data into numerical vectors that can be used as input for the classifier. The Passive Aggressive Classifier is used as the classification algorithm, which makes an initial guess about the class of the input text and then updates its decision boundary based on whether the guess was correct or not.

# Confusion Matrix
After training the classification model, a confusion matrix is plotted to evaluate its performance. The confusion matrix shows the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives for the classifier. In this project, the confusion matrix has a shape of 2x2 and shows the number of correctly and incorrectly classified articles.

# Benefits
Detecting fake news is an important problem in today's world. The Tfidf Vectorizer and Passive Aggressive Classifier libraries are widely used in the industry to detect fake news with high accuracy. These libraries use advanced natural language processing techniques to analyze the text and classify it as real or fake. The confusion matrix provides a visual representation of the performance of the classifier and helps in further improving the accuracy of the model.

Overall, this project is a great example of how to use advanced natural language processing techniques to solve real-world problems like fake news detection. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to follow and reproduce.
